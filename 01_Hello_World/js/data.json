Q magazine's Simon Goddard argued in 2007 that the Smiths were \"the one truly vital voice of the '80s\", \"the most influential British guitar group of the decade\" and the \"first indie outsiders to achieve mainstream success on their own terms\".  The NME named the Smiths the \"most influential artist ever\" in a 2002 poll."
