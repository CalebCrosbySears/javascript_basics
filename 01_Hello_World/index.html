  	<h4 class="story-header active" id="story-header-2">It all begins with a friend...</h4>
  	<div class="story-content active" id="story-content-2">
			<p>It all started in 2005 when I was working as a nanny with a little boy with Down’s syndrome. His name is Gibby. Of his many struggles, medicine time was one of the most difficult for him. It broke my heart to see him face such difficulties with something I believed could and should be much easier. I knew there was a possibility that I might find a way to turn his unpleasant experience into a pleasant one.</p>

		<h4 class="story-header" id="story-header-4">The path to invention is not always easy...</h4>

  	<div class="story-content" id="story-content-4">
			<p>The creative journey started after I came home one day and began constructing an animal that I thought Gibby might find pleasing to look at. Ava the Elephant&reg; was born - made of fabric, sponges, a store bought medicine dropper, and a record-able sound chip from a greeting card!</p>
  		<p>The following day I introduced Ava to Gibby. I explained that I had a new little &quot;friend&quot; that was going to give him is medicine and I pressed the button. He was delighted! Not only did he like Ava, but he took his medicine without any hesitation.</p>
			<p>Gibby's parents were suprised and relieved by this breakthrough. This is when I saw an oppertunity to help other children, like Gibby.</p>

		<h4 class="story-header" id="story-header-6">How to share my new idea...</h4>
  	<div class="story-content" id="story-content-6">
			<p>I began by searching for funding. This was not going to be an easy task. No investor would take my homemade Ava seriously. While searching the internet one day, I found a casting call that said: &quot;Do you have the next million dollar idea but don’t have the funding to make it happen?&quot; Well... here is an oppertunity, lets go to Shark Tank.</p>
  	</div> <!-- story-content -->

		<h4 class="story-header" id="story-header-7">So I take a swim in the Shark Tank.</h4>
  	<div class="story-content" id="story-content-7">
			<p>I applied for the casting, and was invited to be on the first ever episode of Shark Tank. My invention was something that could help me continue with my passion for helping sick children. After filming, the episode of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8F7osrO31A">Shark Tank</a>, I returned home and spent months perfecting Ava so that she would be as safe as she is effective. On the show I told the Sharks that, in my opinion, the issue was not just about the bad taste of medicine, but about the process of taking it. So thats how I became the first Shark Tank &quot;winner&quot; and secured the initial investment needed to develop my product. Barbara Corcoran took a gamble and saw great benefit in my product.</p>

		<h4 class="story-header" id="story-header-12">Not all development challenges are product related</h4>
  	<div class="story-content" id="story-content-12">
			<p>There were many challenges I faced in the first 6 months of development. The one I was never prepared for was a diagnosis of cancer. I was only 28 years old when I was told that I had papillary carcinoma. Between growing my business and now dealing with cancer, I found this was all neccisary if I wanted to succeed. I thank God every day that he brought me through those difficult times and I am currently cancer free!</p>

  	<div class="story-content" id="story-content-14">
			<p>My story continues and will naturally change as time passes. However, I am happy to say that I have been very blessed by many opportunities and have received unparalleled exposure, such as being considered one of the Top 50 Mompreneurs by Babble.com, a keynote speaker at Disney Social Media Mom’s event, a panelist at Tory Johnson’s Spark and Hustle event, mentions on Entrepreneur.com, youngentreprenur.com, mominventors.com and many others. This is how I was  coined a &quot;modern day Mary Poppins.&quot;</p>

		<h4 class="story-header" id="story-header-15">Do not discount online sales!</h4>
  	<div class="story-content" id="story-content-15">
			<p>Ava the Elephant&reg; was available in more than 10,000 retail stores in the United States, including CVS Pharmacy, Kroger, Safeway, BabiesRUs.com, drugstore.com, amazon.com, walgreens.com and others and she received the Certified Miracle Award in 2011. Ava was sold in multiple languages and internationally in Canada, Mexico, and Australia.</p>

		<h4 class="story-header" id="story-header-17">And on with the journey!</h4>
  	<div class="story-content" id="story-content-17">
			<p>Thank you for sharing my entrepreneurial journey. I’ve had the pleasure of meeting countless Shark Tank fans over the years. Hearing that you were cheering me on from home, both in business &amp; while fighting cancer, was so uplifting! This is not the end of my journey… it’s more like a waypoint for the next step.</p>
